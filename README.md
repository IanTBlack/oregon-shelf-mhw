## Usage
The code provided in this repository is intended to be used with Jupyter Lab and is optimized for use on the OOI JupyterHub. However, local usage has been considered. It is recommended that you clone this repository to your user folder, since all processes reference a `oregon-shelf-mhw` folder within that folder. 

`git clone https://github.com/IanTBlack/oregon-shelf-mhw.git`

If you wish to store the cloned repo and data elsewhere, you may need to modify the Python code for this new location.
